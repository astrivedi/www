abstract: "The success of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in human-AI collaborative decision-
making hinges on their ability to provide trust-
worthy, gradual, and tailored explanations.
Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, of-
fers a canonical example of this collaboration,
where clear and customized explanations often
hold greater importance than the final solution.
In this study, we evaluate the performance of
five LLMs in solving and explaining 6×6 Su-
doku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates
limited success in solving puzzles, none can
explain the solution process in a manner that
reflects strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-
solving. These findings underscore significant
challenges that must be addressed before LLMs
can become effective partners in human-AI col-
laborative decision-making."
