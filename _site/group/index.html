      <h2 id="what-we-do">What we do</h2>
<p>
My research group investigates the theoretical foundations and practical applications of
trustworthy artificial intelligence. We emphasize mathematical rigor, clarity of reasoning,
and relevance to real-world systems, including cyber-physical systems and legal- and
social-critical software.
</p>

<p>
We are part of the Programming Languages and Verification (CUPLV) group at CU Boulder.

<h2 id="how-the-group-works">How the group works</h2>
<p>
Research in the group is driven by regular technical discussions, careful reading and
writing, and a strong emphasis on foundational understanding. Group members are encouraged
to develop independence while engaging deeply with one another’s work.
</p>

<p>
Most projects combine theory with systems-oriented thinking. We value precise problem
formulation, clear explanations, and constructive feedback, and we aim to develop
researchers with strong long-term judgment and research taste.
</p>
<div class="sectionline"></div>
<h2 id="join-the-group">Join the group</h2>
<p>
I am recruiting PhD students and occasional postdocs interested in formal methods,
reinforcement learning, cyber-physical systems, and AI accountability. Strong theoretical
foundations and curiosity about real-world impact are especially welcome.
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in joining the group, please send a concise email describing your
background and research interests. Prospective PhD students should also consult the
