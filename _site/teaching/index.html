      <h1>Teaching</h1>

<p>
My teaching emphasizes mathematical rigor, conceptual clarity, and the connection between
theoretical foundations and real-world systems. I regularly teach courses in theoretical
computer science, reinforcement learning, and cyber-physical systems at both the graduate
and undergraduate levels.
</p>

<p>
I aim to help students develop a deep, principled understanding of computing systems,
with an emphasis on reasoning from first principles and making assumptions explicit. My
courses balance mathematical rigor with intuition, and I encourage students to engage
actively with ideas rather than treat theory as a collection of techniques.

<h3>Graduate courses</h3>

<p>
<strong>CSCI 7000 – Theoretical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning</strong><br />
<em>Summer 2023, Spring 2024</em><br />
This course explores the mathematical foundations of reinforcement learning, covering
classical tabular methods and modern deep RL. Topics include value functions, Bellman
equations, reward engineering, environment design, convergence guarantees, and scalability
challenges.
</p>

<p>
<strong>CSCI 5854 – Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems</strong><br />
<em>Spring 2018</em><br />
Introduces the design and verification of safety-critical cyber-physical systems using
formal modeling, specification languages, and verification techniques for discrete,
continuous, and hybrid dynamical systems.
</p>

<p>
<strong>CSCI 5454 – Design and Analysis of Algorithms</strong><br />
<em>Fall 2017</em><br />
A core graduate-level course covering foundational and advanced algorithms, with an
emphasis on rigorous analysis techniques.
</p>

<p>
<strong>CSCI 5444 – Theory of Computation</strong><br />
<em>Spring 2017, Fall 2018, Fall 2020–2023</em><br />
Graduate-level introduction to automata theory, computability, and complexity. The course
assumes mathematical maturity and, in later offerings, incorporated topics from
computational learning theory.
</p>

<h3>Undergraduate courses</h3>

<p>
<strong>CSCI 3434 – Theory of Computation</strong><br />
<em>Fall 2016, Fall 2023</em><br />
Introductory theory course covering formal models of computation, from finite automata to
Turing machines, as well as computability and complexity. Designed for students with
minimal prior exposure to theoretical computer science.
</p>

<p>
<strong>CSCI 2270 – Data Structures</strong><br />
<em>Spring 2019–2023</em><br />
Core undergraduate course introducing the theoretical foundations and practical
implementation of fundamental data structures.
</p>

<div class="sectionline"></div>

<h2>Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</h2>

<p>
<strong>CS208 – Automata Theory and Logic</strong><br />
<em>Summer 2012–13, Spring 2013–14, Spring 2014–15</em><br />
Undergraduate course covering automata theory and foundational logic for computation,
comparable in scope to CSCI 3434 at CU Boulder.
</p>

<p>
<strong>CS226 – Digital Logic Design (Theory + Lab)</strong><br />
<em>Spring 2014–15</em><br />
Course covering combinational and sequential circuit design, including synchronous and
asynchronous logic.
</p>

<p>
<strong>CS620 – Modeling and Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems</strong><br />
<em>Autumn 2013–14</em><br />
Graduate seminar focused on modeling and verification of cyber-physical systems, with
emphasis on hybrid systems and formal verification tools.
