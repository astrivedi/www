<h1>Bio</h1>

<p>
Ashutosh Trivedi is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Colorado
Boulder and a Royal Society Wolfson Visiting Fellow at the University of Liverpool. His
research lies at the intersection of formal methods, control theory, and machine learning,
with a focus on bridging the gap between machine learning and responsible system design.
</p>

<p>
He develops mathematically grounded techniques to ensure that AI-enabled systems behave
safely, fairly, and accountably, even as they learn, adapt, and operate in the real world.
His work spans reinforcement learning, cyber-physical systems, and legal-critical software,
using logic, automata theory, and formal specification to bring clarity and verifiability
to AI behavior.
</p>

<p>
He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Warwick, specializing in
game theory and quantitative verification. Prior to joining CU Boulder, he held academic
positions at IIT Bombay, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Oxford.
</p>

<p>
His research has been recognized with the NSF CAREER Award (2022), a Royal Society Wolfson
Visiting Fellowship (2024), and best paper awards at CAV, HSCC, and SAS. He regularly serves
on program committees for leading conferences in formal methods, AI, and cyber-physical
systems, and is an editor of <em>Information Processing Letters</em> (Elsevier).
