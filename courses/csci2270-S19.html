    <h3> Course Outcomes </h3>
    In this course, students will:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Document code including precondition/postcondition contracts for
	functions and invariants for classes.
      <li>
	Create and recognize appropriate test data for simple problems,
	including testing boundary conditions and creating/running test cases.
      <li>
	Design and test new classes using the principle of information hiding
	for the following data structures: array-based collections (including
	dynamic arrays), list-based collections (singly-linked lists,
	doubly-linked lists, circular-linked lists), stacks, queues, binary search
	trees, hash tables, graphs, and at least one balanced search tree.
      <li>
	Identify features and applications of common data structures,
	including records/structs, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and maps.
      <li>
	Implement algorithms for standard operations on common data structures
	and discuss the complexity of the operations.
      <li>
	Comment on the features of different traversal methods for trees and
	graphs, including pre-, post-, and in-order traversal of trees.
      <li>
	Describe the implementation of hash tables, including algorithms for
	collision avoidance and resolution.
      <li>
	Describe the principles of recursion and iteration, and implement
	recursive and iterative solutions for a problem.
      <li>
	Formulate and implement solutions to problems using fundamental graph
	algorithms, including depth-first and breadth-first search and a
	shortest-path algorithm.
      <li>
	Explain the features of at least one tree balancing algorithm and
	how tree balancing affects the efficiency of various binary search tree
	operations.
      <li>
	Correctly use and manipulate pointer variables to change variables
	and build dynamic data structures.
      <li>
	Explain the differences between dynamic and static data structure
	implementations, and justify the use of static and dynamic
	implementations in different applications.
      <li>
	Practice explaining design choices and algorithm features in
	small-group settings.

<h3> Notes </h3>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <b> Accommodation Statement. </b> 
    If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to me a
    letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations
    provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that your needs can
    be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented
    disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at dsinfo
    [AT] colorado.edu.
    If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Injuries
    under Quick Links at the Disability Services website and discuss your needs with
    me.  
  <li>
    <b> Religious Observances. </b>
    Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every
    effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious
    obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required
    attendance. In this class, you should notify your instructor of any conflict at
    least two weeks in advance. See full details 
    <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html"> here  </a>.
  <li>
    <b> Classroom Behavior. </b> 
    Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate
    learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may
    be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially
    important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of
    race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran's status, sexual
    orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and
    nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's
    legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name
    or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so
    that I may make appropriate changes to my records. For more information, see the
    policies
    on <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior">
      classroom behavior </a>  and
    the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/sites/default/files/attached-files/studentconductcode_16-17-a.pdf">
      student code</a>.

    It is my expectation that each of you will be respectful to your fellow
    classmates and instructors at all times.
    In order to create a professional atmosphere within the classroom,
    you are expected to:
    <ul>
      <li> Arrive to class on time.
      <li> Turn off your cell phone (talk and text).
      <li>  Bring your laptop to class&mdash;if you have one&mdash; to participate in classroom
	activities. Please restrict
	laptop use to these activities only, no email, Facebook, Youtube, etc.
      <li> Put away newspapers and magazines.
      <li> Refrain from having disruptive conversations during class.
      <li> Remain for the whole class; if you must leave early, do so without
    disrupting others.
      <li> Display professional courtesy and respect in all interactions related to
    this class
    Compliance with these expectations will assist all of us in creating a
    learning community and a high
    quality educational experience.
    Though many of the above stated policies address academic climate within the
    classroom, these policies
    should also be upheld outside of the classroom. As a member of the CU
    community you are expected to
    consistently demonstrate integrity and honor through your everyday
    actions. Faculty, TAs, and staff
    members are very willing to assist with your academic and personal
    needs. However, multiple
    professional obligations make it necessary for us to schedule our
    availability. Suggestions specific to
    interactions with faculty and staff include:
	<ul>
      <li> Respect posted office hours. Plan your weekly schedule to align with
    scheduled office hours.
    <li> Avoid disrupting ongoing meetings within faculty and staff offices. Please
    wait until the meeting
    concludes before seeking assistance. Respect faculty and staff policies
    regarding use of email and
    note that staff and faculty are not expected to respond to email outside of
    business hours. Send
    email messages to faculty and staff using a professional format. Tips for a
    professional email
    include:
    <li> Always fill in the subject line with a topic that indicates the reason for
    your email to your reader.
    <li> Respectfully address the individual to whom you are sending the email
    (e.g., Dear Professor
    Smith).
    <li> Avoid email or text message abbreviations.
    <li> Be brief and polite.
    <li> Add a signature block with appropriate contact information.

    <b>Discrimination and Harassment.</b>
    The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to maintaining a
    positive learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate
    acts of sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment or related retaliation
    against or by any employee or student. CU's Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibits
    sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, intimate partner abuse
    (dating or domestic violence), stalking or related retaliation. CU Boulder's
    Discrimination and Harassment Policy prohibits discrimination, harassment or
    related retaliation based on race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age,
    disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
    expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political
    philosophy. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct under
    either policy should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance
    (OIEC) at 303-492-2127. Information about the OIEC, the above referenced
    policies, and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding
    sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment or related retaliation can be

    <b> Submitting Work Late. </b>
    Late work is not accepted in CSCI 2270. In the event of a documented
    personal, family, or medical emergency, consult your TA about receiving a
    penalty free extension.
    If you know you will be missing a weekly recitation, go to a recitation with
    the same TA being held at a different time.
    Recitation assignments are due by the end of recitation. Your lowest
    recitation grade will be dropped.
  <li> <b> Attendance.</b>
    Attendance at all class meetings and recitations is required. You are
    responsible for knowing the material
    presented during class and recitation, even if you were not in attendance
    when the material was
    presented.
  <!-- <li> <b> Other Information. </b> -->
  <!--   Written work must be neat and readable, with adequate spacing and -->
  <!--   margins. Your name, the date, and your section number must be at the top -->
  <!--   right of the first page. Code files should have your name, date, -->
  <!--   and homework number included as comments at the top of the file. -->
  <!--   A limited amount of printing may be required in this class. You need to -->
  <!--   ensure that your printing account -->
  <!--   has sufficient funds for this. Your initial allocation may deplete quickly, -->
  <!--   depending on your other printing -->
  <!--   activities. If this causes problems, please come see me. -->

    <b> Honor Code. </b>
    All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible
    for knowing and adhering to
    the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/academic-integrity-policy">academic
      integrity policy </a> of the 
    institution. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating,
    fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access, clicker fraud,
    resubmission, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic
    misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu;
    303-735-2273). Students who are found responsible for violating the academic
    integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code
    Council as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional
    information regarding the academic integrity policy can be found at
    <a href="http://honorcode.colorado.edu/">honorcode.colorado.edu</a>.


  <li> <b> Collaboration Policy. </b>
    The Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder
    encourages collaboration among students. Students are most successful when
    they are working with other students to understand new concepts. The
    ultimate goal is that you fully understand the code you develop and be able
    to collaborate with others in a mutually beneficial way. 
    To support students in collaboration, the Department has created a
    Collaboration Policy that makes explicit when their collaborative behavior
    is within the bounds of collaboration and when it is actually
    academic dishonesty, and therefore a violation of the University of Colorado
    at Boulder's Honor Code.
    Unless otherwise specified, you may make reasonable use of outside resources
    (the Internet, other books, people), but then you must give credit by citing
    your sources in the comments inside your code.
    Reasonable use of outside resources does NOT include downloading complete,
    or almost complete, solutions to an assignment, or acquiring a complete, or
    almost complete, solution from any source,
    whether you cite the source of the solution or not. This is considered
    plagiarism and violates the University's Honor Code policy.
    Examples of citing sources include:
    <ul>
      <li> // Modified version from https://github.com/Phhere/MOSS-PHP
      <li> // Adapted from Program #7.2 in book "Accelerated C++" by B. Stroustrup
      <li> // Worked with Joe Smith from class to come up with algorithm for sorting
      <li> // Received suggestions from StackExchange website (see http://...)
    </ul>
    A good rule of thumb: <i> If it did not come from your brain, then you need to
      attribute where you got it.</i>
    <b>Collaboration Exceptions:</b>
    Certain homework, quizzes, or exams may be required to be completed without
    outside resources. In this
    class, this includes the midterm and final exams. Use of outside resources
    in these cases violates the
    collaboration policy.
    <br>
    Examples of violating the Collaboration Policy
    <ul>
      <li>  Sharing a file with someone else.
      <li> Submitting a file that someone else shared with you.
      <li> Stealing a copy of someone else's work and submitting as your own (even
	with modification).
      <li> Copying or using outside resources to solve a component of a larger
	problem and not citing your
	sources.
      <li> Copying or using an entire solution that you did not generate, regardless
	of whether you cited your
	sources.
      <li> Downloading a solution from the Internet and modifying it to make it look
	like your own work.
    </ul>
    <br>
    Examples of collaborating correctly:
    <ul>
      <li>  Asking another student for a helpful suggestion.
      <li> Reviewing another student's code for issues/bugs/errors.
      <li> Working together on the whiteboard (or paper) to figure out how to
	approach and solve the
	problem. In this case you must include that person's name in your
	collaboration list at the top of your submission.
    </ul>
    One way to know you are collaborating well is if everyone fully understands
    the solution that is developed. If you do not understand what is in the work
    you are submitting, you need to spend the time to learn the material before
    you submit your assignment. This collaboration policy requires that you be
    able to create the code (or solve the problem) on your own before you submit
    your assignment. If any member of the instructional team believes that you
    are submitting someone  else's work, you might be called upon to explain
    your solution in a one-on-one meeting with the instructor to receive credit
    for the work.
    Any discovered incidents of violation of this collaboration policy will be
    treated as violations of the University's Academic Integrity Policy and will
    lead to an automatic academic sanction in the course and a report to both
    the College of Engineering and Applied Science and the Honor Code
    Council. Students who are found to be in violation of the Academic Integrity
    Policy can be subject to non-academic sanctions as well, including but not
    limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion.
    <br>
    
    Other information on the Honor Code can be found at
    www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html and
    www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode.
    Collaboration boundaries are hard to define crisply and may differ from
    class to class. If you are in any
    doubt about where they lie for a particular course, it is your
    responsibility to ask the course instructor.
