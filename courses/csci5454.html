<h3> Notes </h3>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <b> Accommodation Statement. </b> 
    If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to me a
    letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations
    provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that your needs can
    be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented
    disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at dsinfo
    [AT] colorado.edu.
    If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Injuries
    under Quick Links at the Disability Services website and discuss your needs with
    me.  
  <li>
    <b> Religious Observances. </b>
    Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every
    effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious
    obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required
    attendance. In this class, you should notify your instructor of any conflict at
    least two weeks in advance. See full details 
    <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html"> here  </a>.
  <li>
    <b> Classroom Behavior. </b> 
    Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate
    learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may
    be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially
    important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of
    race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran's status, sexual
    orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability, and
    nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's
    legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name
    or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so
    that I may make appropriate changes to my records. For more information, see the
    policies
    on <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior">
      classroom behavior </a>  and
    the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/osccr/sites/default/files/attached-files/studentconductcode_16-17-a.pdf">
      student code</a>. 

  <li> 
    <b>Discrimination and Harassment.</b>
    The University of Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) is committed to maintaining a
    positive learning, working, and living environment. CU Boulder will not tolerate
    acts of sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment or related retaliation
    against or by any employee or student. CU's Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibits
    sexual assault, sexual exploitation, sexual harassment, intimate partner abuse
    (dating or domestic violence), stalking or related retaliation. CU Boulder's
    Discrimination and Harassment Policy prohibits discrimination, harassment or
    related retaliation based on race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age,
    disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
    expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political
    philosophy. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct under
    either policy should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance
    (OIEC) at 303-492-2127. Information about the OIEC, the above referenced
    policies, and the campus resources available to assist individuals regarding
    sexual misconduct, discrimination, harassment or related retaliation can be
    found at
    the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/institutionalequity/"> OIEC website</a>. 

  <li> 
    <b> Honor Code. </b>
    All students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible
    for knowing and adhering to
    the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/academic-integrity-policy">academic
      integrity policy </a> of the 
    institution. Violations of the policy may include: plagiarism, cheating,
    fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access, clicker fraud,
    resubmission, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic
    misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu;
    303-735-2273). Students who are found responsible for violating the academic
    integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code
    Council as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional
    information regarding the academic integrity policy can be found at
    <a href="http://honorcode.colorado.edu/">honorcode.colorado.edu</a>.
