## What we do
<p>
My research group investigates the theoretical foundations and practical applications of trustworthy artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on mathematical rigor, clarity of reasoning, and relevance to real-world systems such as cyber-physical systems and legal- and social-critical software. We are part of the <a class="link" href="https://plv.colorado.edu">Programming Languages and Verification (CUPLV)</a> group at CU Boulder.

## How the group works
<p>
Research in the group is driven by regular technical discussions, careful reading and
writing, and a strong emphasis on foundational understanding. Group members are encouraged
to develop independence while engaging deeply with one another’s work.
</p>

<p>
Most projects combine theory with systems-oriented thinking. We value precise problem
formulation, clear explanations, and constructive feedback, and we aim to develop
researchers with strong long-term judgment and research taste.

## Join the group
<p>
I am recruiting PhD students and occasional postdocs interested in formal methods,
reinforcement learning, cyber-physical systems, and AI accountability. Strong theoretical
foundations and curiosity about real-world impact are especially welcome.
