<p>
I completed my  Ph.D. working
with <a href="http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~mju">Marcin Jurdzinski</a> at the
University of Warwick in 2009.  
After this I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Marta Kwiatkowska at the
University of Oxford and with Rajeev Alur at the University of Pennsylvania. 
I also worked as an assistant professor in the CSE department at IIT Bombay for
three years before joining the University of Colorado.
