What properties about the internals of a program explain the possible
differences in its overall running time for different inputs? In this paper, we
propose a formal framework for considering this question we dub trace-set
discrimination. We show that even though the algorithmic problem of computing
maximum likelihood discriminants is NP-hard, approaches based on integer linear
programming (ILP) and decision tree learning can be useful in zeroing-in on the
program internals. On a set of Java benchmarks, we find that compactly&mdash;represented
decision trees scalably discriminate with high accuracy&mdash;more scalably than
maximum likelihood discriminants and with comparable accuracy. We demonstrate on
three larger case studies how decision-tree discriminants produced by our tool
are useful for debugging timing side-channel vulnerabilities (i.e., where a
malicious observer infers secrets simply from passively watching execution
times) and availability vulnerabilities.
