Efficient planning algorithms form central components in various stages of
autonomous vehicle navigation right from route planning to lower-level motion
planning. The classical piano mover’s problem&mdash;of moving a piano from one room to
another while avoiding hitting other obstacles&mdash;and its variants are paradigmatic
examples of such planning problems and have been extensively studied in 
robotics and artificial intelligence. As a result a number of practical
solutions exists ranging from "best-effort" sampling-based techniques such as
rapidly exploring random trees and dense trees, to "complete" combinatorial
techniques such as cylindrical algebraic decomposition algorithm and Canny’s
algorithm. The general motion planning problem with polyhedral obstacles was
shown (Reif 1979) to be PSPACE-complete and certain form of planning under
uncertainty in 3D environment is known (Canny and Reif 1987, and Canny 1988) to
be NEXPTIME-hard. In this paper we take a fresh look at this classical problem,
and give a precise boundary between de- cidable and undecidable motion planning
problems for systems with simple and natural dynamics. For this purpose we
consider constant-rate multi-mode systems and study reach-while-avoid problem
for point-objects with obstacles given using linear inequalities. We show that
this problem is in general undecidable, and we recover decidability by making
certain assumptions about the obstacles. We also present a new algorithm to
solve this problem and compare the performance with sampling based algorithms.
