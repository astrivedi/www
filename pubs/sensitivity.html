<h2>
Analyzing Neighborhoods of Falsifying Traces in Cyber-Physical Systems.

<p>
We study the problem of analyzing falsifying traces of cyber-physical
systems. Specifically, given a system model and an input which is a
counterexample to a property of interest, we wish to understand which parts of
the inputs are "responsible" for the counterexample as a whole. Whereas this
problem is well known to be hard to solve precisely, we provide an approach
based on learning from repeated simulations of the system under test.
</p>
<p>
Our approach generalizes the classic concept of "one-at-a-time" sensitivity
analysis used in the risk and decision analysis commu- nity to understand how
inputs to a system influence a property in question. Specifically, we pose the
problem as one of finding a neighborhood of inputs that contains the falsifying
counterexample in question, such that each point in this neighborhood
corresponds to a falsifying input with a high probability. We use ideas from
sta- tistical hypothesis testing to infer and validate such neighborhoods from
repeated simulations of the system under test. This approach not only helps to
understand the sensitivity of these counterexam- ples to various parts of the
inputs, but also generalizes or widens the given counterexample by returning a
neighborhood of coun- terexamples around it.
</p>
<p>
We demonstrate our approach on a series of increasingly com- plex examples from
automotive and closed loop medical device domains. We also compare our approach
against related techniques based on regression and machine learning.
