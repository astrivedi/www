      I am actively working on the following research projects: 
      <ol >
	<li> <b> Securing Space/Time Defenses in Java Bytecode</b>. 
	  The goal of this DARPA-sponsored project is to develop new program analysis
	  techniques to allow analysts to discover Java applications with exploitable
	  security vulnerabilities such as availability 
	  	    <img src="pic1.png" alt="Discriminer"
		 style="float:right;width:260px;">
	  	  (denial-of-service) and confidentiality (side-channels) vulnerabilities due to space and time usage
	  of the programs.  
	  In identifying availability and confidentiality
	  problems, our focus is to minimize both false positives and false negatives. 
	  In addition, it is often desirable that every identified vulnerability is
	  presented with sufficient evidence towards an exploit of 
	  the vulnerability. In the case of availability problems, such evidence should
	  be in the form of an input that triggers excessive resource usage, while for
	  confidentiality problems, such evience may be pair of inputs that result in
	  differential resource usage.
	  I am particularly interested in combining static analysis techniques with
	  run-time analysis to pinpoint program vulnerabilities. 
	  In one of our recent publications <a href="pubs/discriminer.html">[1]</a>, we present a new run-time analysis
	  technique for debuggin Java bytecode to uncover potential causes for
	  side-channels in time.  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <b> Related publications</b> : <a href="pubs/discriminer.html">[1]</a>.
	<li> <b>Formal Sensitivity-analysis for Cyber-Physical Systems</b>. In this
	  Toyota-sponsored project I investigate simulation-based approaches to analyze a given set of counterexamples to
	  correctness properties of CPS towards explaining and widening the
	  <img src="pic2.png" alt="Automotive CPS"
	       style="float:left;width:320px;">
	  counterexamples to assist the system designer in further debugging.
	  The resulting approach can be used by engineers to
	  debug their CPS designs inside practical environments such as Simulink/Stateflow
	  in MATLAB. 
	  Our approach extends classical sensitivity analysis to generalize neighborhood
	  of counterexamples by computing a box neighborhood around the original 
	  counterexample, so that sampling inputs in our neighborhood is highly likely to
	  also produce a counterexample. The effectiveness of this approach was
	  successfully
	  demonstrated over many CPS models including automotive and closed-loop medical
	  device control systems.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <b> Related publications</b> : <a href="pubs/sensitivity.html">[1]</a>.
	  <br>
	  	<li> <b> Theory of Stochastic Hybrid Structures</b>.
	  The problem of mathematically modeling CPS is fundamental to analyzing their
	  safety and security properties. However, CPS integrate many different
	  aspects including time-criticality, nondeterminism, 
	    <img src="pic3.png" alt="stochastic timed automata"
		 style="float:right;width:210px;">
	  presence of multiple
	  rational agents, rich continuous dynamics, stochastic behavior, and
	  higher-level programming constructs such as heaps and recursion. This poses
	  a fundamental challenge: a rich combination of these features yields models
	  that are too complex to reason about. In this project I study several useful
	  restrictions to these models to characterize the
	  decidability/undecidability frontier as well as exact computational
	  complexity of various verification and synthesis related questions.
	  Parts of this projects were sponsored by a Liverpool-India fellowship,
	  an IIT Bombay seed-grant, and the Indo-french project <a href="http://www.labri.fr/perso/herbrete/averts/index.html">AVeRTS</a>.

	  <br>
	 	<li> <b> Theory of Streaming String Transducers</b>.
	  The beautiful theory of regular languages is the cornerstone of theoretical
	  computer science and formal language theory. The perfect harmony among the
	  languages of finite words definable using
	    <img src="pic4.png" alt="Streaming String Transducers"
		 style="float:left;width:240px;">
	  abstract machines (deterministic
	  finite automata),  algebra (regular expressions and finite monoids), and logic (monadic
	  second-order logic) did set the stage for the generalizations of the
	  theory to the theory of regular languages of infinite words,
	  trees, and partial orders.
	  Alur and Cerny have proposed a model of transducers, called
	  <i> streaming string transducers</i>, that for regular transformations seems
	  to be as appealing model as deterministic finite automata for regular languages.
	  The goal of this project is to study theoretical properties of streaming string
	  transducers and  their applications in verification of CPS.
	  This project has been supported by the NSF Expeditions in Computing award
	  1138996 and an IITB seed-grant.
