<h1>Teaching</h1>

<p>
My teaching emphasizes mathematical rigor, conceptual clarity, and the connection between
theoretical foundations and real-world systems. I regularly teach courses in theoretical
computer science, reinforcement learning, and cyber-physical systems at both the graduate
and undergraduate levels.
</p>

<p>
I aim to help students develop a deep, principled understanding of computing systems,
with an emphasis on reasoning from first principles and making assumptions explicit. My
courses balance mathematical rigor with intuition, and I encourage students to engage
actively with ideas rather than treat theory as a collection of techniques.

<h3>Graduate courses</h3>

<p>
<strong>CSCI 7000 – Theoretical Foundations of Reinforcement Learning</strong><br/>
<em>Summer 2023, Spring 2024</em><br/>
This course explores the mathematical foundations of reinforcement learning, covering
classical tabular methods and modern deep RL. Topics include value functions, Bellman
equations, reward engineering, environment design, convergence guarantees, and scalability
challenges.
</p>

<p>
<strong>CSCI 5854 – Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems</strong><br/>
<em>Spring 2018</em><br/>
Introduces the design and verification of safety-critical cyber-physical systems using
formal modeling, specification languages, and verification techniques for discrete,
continuous, and hybrid dynamical systems.
</p>

<p>
<strong>CSCI 5454 – Design and Analysis of Algorithms</strong><br/>
<em>Fall 2017</em><br/>
A core graduate-level course covering foundational and advanced algorithms, with an
emphasis on rigorous analysis techniques.
